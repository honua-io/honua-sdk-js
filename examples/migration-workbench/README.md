# ArcGIS Migration Workbench

This sample presents the committed, deterministic artifacts produced by the
repository's `honua-migrate` CLI for the Honua-authored `arcgis-source-app`
fixture. It is an evidence viewer and browser runtime proof, not a second
migration engine.

The workbench:

- loads the versioned JSON report, widget guidance, MapLibre assessment,
  manifest, and patch from `public/artifacts/v1`;
- imports the committed generated target, which uses the public
  `@honua/sdk-js/esri-compat` entry point;
- compares the generated target's browser observations with every stored
  expected behavior assertion;
- retains zero-count, manual, unsupported, failed-gate, and alternative
  MapLibre findings instead of filtering them out; and
- exposes the exact fixed-argument CLI commands, SHA-256 manifest entries, and
  source/target patch.

It does not accept files, upload source, read browser credentials, invoke a
transform, or perform a cloud import. Artifact generation remains a repository
build step owned by Slice 1:

```bash
npm run demo:migration-workbench:artifacts:check
```

## Required follow-up step: register the widget kit

Reading a green migration report is not the end of the migration. `LegendCompat`
and `LayerListCompat` carry the ArcGIS state model but render UI only after the
application injects the Honua web-component kit, and the codemod does not insert
that call for you (honua-io/honua-sdk-js#957). Add it once to the migrated entry
point:

```ts doc-test=skip reason="wiring snippet requires an application host"
import { registerHonuaWidgetKit } from "@honua/sdk-js/esri-compat";

registerHonuaWidgetKit(() => import("@honua/sdk-js/web-components"));
```

Skip it and those two widgets come up blank while every report gate stays green.
The first mount in that state warns on the console and emits a
`widget-kit.missing` event on the shim's `CompatEventBus`. Other
container-bearing shims (`SearchCompat`, `MeasurementCompat`, …) do not
delegate to the kit at all and stay state-model-only either way, so they need
their own rendering plan; see
[widget kit registration](../../docs/migration-honua-maplibre.md#widget-kit-registration)
for the full contract.

Run the workbench locally:

```bash
npm run demo:migration-workbench
```

Focused validation:

```bash
npm test -- test/migration-workbench-model.test.ts
npm run demo:migration-workbench:typecheck
npm run demo:migration-workbench:build
npm run test:playwright:migration-workbench
```

The Vite configuration uses the shared sample SDK resolver and declares only
the public `@honua/sdk-js/esri-compat` entry point. The focused Playwright proof
runs unchanged in source or packed mode:

```bash
HONUA_SAMPLE_SDK_MODE=source npm run test:playwright:migration-workbench
HONUA_SAMPLE_SDK_MODE=packed \
  HONUA_SAMPLE_SDK_DIR=/absolute/path/to/extracted/package \
  npm run test:playwright:migration-workbench
```

The loopback-only browser proof checks every rendered metric against the
committed model, re-hashes all five manifest files from their served bytes,
confirms all generated-target assertions, retains every residual and guide,
runs Axe and keyboard/responsive workflows, captures desktop/mobile evidence,
enforces deterministic ready-time and decoded-byte budgets, and proves
idempotent runtime and fixture teardown. The mock server can emit its bounded
fixture receipt independently:

```bash
npm run demo:migration-workbench:mock -- --evidence-once
```

The adapted `test/fixtures/esri-demo-feature-table-relates-app` fixture is not
used or exposed here because public license evidence for it was not established.
The artifact manifest records that exclusion and the Apache-2.0 scope of the
Honua-authored source fixture.
